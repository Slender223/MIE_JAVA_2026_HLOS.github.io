                Computer Science and Statistics graduate with a strong foundation in programming and analytical problem-solving, seeking to build a long-term career as a software developer. Currently pursuing a Java training at Mecer Inter-Ed to strengthen my object-oriented programming skills and gain hands-on experience in building scalable applications. So far, I have developed academic and practical projects that enhanced my coding, logical thinking, and data analysis abilities, and I am eager to apply these skills in a professional development environment.
